A pretty raw example of web server in Javscript using/in Bun.

### Why?
Just wanted to get the feel of bun

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v0.1.8. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
